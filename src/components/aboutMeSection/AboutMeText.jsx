      <p>
        Iâ€™m Ayush Raj, a final-year Computer Science student at NIT Jalandhar with a strong passion for web development and technology. I specialize in React and front-end development, and I love building real-world projects that solve practical problems. I'm deeply committed to continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge with peers through collaborative coding and open-source contributions. Beyond academics, I actively explore the latest trends in tech, aiming to grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
